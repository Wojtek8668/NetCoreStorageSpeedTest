# NetCoreStorageSpeedTest
Console Application (Linux, Windows and MacOS - .NET Core 3) and a cross-platform Class Library (C#, .NET Standard 2) for measuring read/write speeds of disks/storage devices.

The class library is the perfomance measuring core of CPDT Benchmark (Cross Platform Disk Test): https://github.com/maxim-saplin/CrossPlatformDiskTest

There's a console app (started via Terminal) which runs same tests as CPDT, though only with default options and no way to change them.
